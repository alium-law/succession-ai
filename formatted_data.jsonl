Family law\nFamily law and succession law are interdependent. In many respects, the law of succession is seen as part of family law, in the sense that following the demise of a family member, his property is usually shared out among the members of his family who survive him. The heirs or beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased, in most jurisdictions, are family members. In testate succession, there is a moral obligation on the part of the testator, while disposing off his property in total freedom of testation, to provide for his family. The law usually inserts provisions in the law allowing family members to move to court to challenge a testament that does not provide for them and the court is vested with power to interfere where there is inadequate provision for a family member. For these reasons, family(reference 3) Law is seen as having a strong bearing on succession law. Most of the succession disputes turn on family law questions, such as whether a person claiming to be a heir or dependant of the deceased or to be beneficially interested in the estate of the deceased, was a spouse or child of the deceased or related to the deceased in some legal way.\nb. Law of trusts\nIn administration of estates of deceased persons, the issue of trust inevitably arises. The property of the deceased vests in the personal representative who holds the real and personal property of the deceased for the benefit of others, and not his own. In the circumstances, the personal representative holds the property in trust for all the creditors and beneficiaries who are entitled to the estate of the deceased. He stands in a fiduciary position with regard to the property and in his relationship with the creditors and beneficiaries. Under the Trustee Act\/' the definition of trustee includes a personal representative, although the true relationship of the two officers is not exactly the same, but the personal representative may become a trustee in the full sense.

The word 'family' is widely construed in this context to include not only the immediate family members, but also distant relations and in some cases the clan. Yet in some societies particularly in the west, the property goes to the persons identified by the deceased in his will, regardless of the relationship between them and the deceased. For example, in England, prior to 1938, the heirs of a deceased person were the persons he chose in his will. However, with the passing of the Inheritance (Family Provisions) Act of 1938, the freedom to will away one's property to strangers was fettered by statute. The legislation gave the persons who were dependent on the deceased immediately prior to his death, the right to apply to court for provision from the estate. It was felt that the burden of maintaining such persons should not be shifted to the state by the testator, who was dead in any event. The courts were empowered by this statute to order for a reasonable provision for the dependants from the estate(reference 5).\nb.
